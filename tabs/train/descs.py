<span style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">1.  Codename;0's recommended approach:</span>
- Set Normalization to: **post_rms**
- Set Audio cutting to: **Simple**

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Dataset requirements:</span>
- **1 continuous / concatenated audio file** instead of many independent short segments/files.
- Apply **silence truncation** ( keeping short silence gaps around **80–120 ms** is fine ).
- Ensure your dataset isn't busted in terms of volume / dynamic range or peaks. ( What can help: Peak / RMS compression or "Leveler" if you have iZotope RX )

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">EXTRA INFO:</span>
- **Audacity** is a great free tool for the first 2 things I mention above if you don't have another alternative.
- For quick concatenation, drag and drop a folder containing multiple audio files onto **run_concat.bat** located in the **EXTRAS** folder (**found in the root directory of this fork**).

<br/>

<span style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">2. Lazy / Low effort approach ( Not recommended.):</span>
- Set Normalization to: **post_peak**
- Set Audio cutting to: **Automatic**
<br/> ⚠ ( Yet I'd still recommend to go with the 1st approach if you want training stability and more consistent results.

<br/>

<span style="font-size: 25px; font-weight: bold;">3. Experimental alternative approach:</span>
- Enable "SmartCutter" by ticking the checkbox
- Set Normalization to: **post_rms**
- Set Audio cutting to: **Simple**

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Requirements:</span>
- **1 continuous / concatenated audio file** instead of many independent short segments/files.
<br/> ⚠ ( **There is a chance** SmartCutter might not work well on your dataset.. In that case just go for one of the above approaches. )

<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">EXTRA INFO:</span>
- SmartCutter was made with base/pretrain model creation in mind.
- The model is meant to detect silent/low-noise gaps that are +100ms long, replace them with digital-silence and trim to 100ms.
- By design should respect zero-crossings and avoid cutting into breaths and organic sounds but might make mistakes.

<br/>

` NOTES ` <br/>
1. Remember.. Dataset is the very foundation of your model. If you use awful datasets, don't expect miraculous results.. AI is not a magical tool like that.
2. Generally.. you shouldn't tweak these default settings unless you know you're doing it.
